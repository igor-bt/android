# Jetpack Compose with Material Design 3

- This is an app I made when I was starting to learn about Jetpack Compose. It is a modern toolkit for building native UI as described [here](https://developer.android.com/jetpack/compose).
- It is also using Material Design 3, the currently latest design system from Google, more infos [here](https://m3.material.io).

### About the app

* It simulates a chat conversation implementing some composable elements like Row, Column, Image, Text and modifiers like elevation and animation.
* The color system of this app is the default colorScheme by MaterialDesign3. Dark and light modes are managed automatically by the system.
* The base app can be built as shown in [Jetpack Compose Tutorial](https://developer.android.com/jetpack/compose/tutorial). My version has some particular changes according to my desire during the development.
